            Some of the things we'll cover here are setting base paths for templateUrls and route paths. Also how
            an angular-route or ui-router route can be <strong>componentized</strong>. If you checkout the new
            <a href="http://github.com/angular/router">Angular 2.x Router</a> you'll notice that this is baked in.
            We've been doing similar with the previous mentioned routers for some time as this simplifies route
            definitions and makes it easier to automate route creation as well. Also discussed is how we can extend
            our area object and access it from $rootScope. Additionally we'll show how you can access $basap itself
            from the <strong>Base Controller</strong>.
        </p>
        <h4>Mapping Paths</h4>
        <p>
            You can map templateUrl and route paths independently. This is useful in the case where you have an area
            and each path should be prefixed with this path. This is nothing more than string concatenation however it
            is very handy to make code more clear and in short limit key strokes. With templateUrls it is the same thing
            the templateUrl is joined with the specified base path so that the templates resolve properly. Some examples
            below. Both are set as options in either basap initialization options or area initialization options.
        </p>
        <pre>
            // see home for importing "basap"<br/>
            var app = basap('myapp', { routeBase: '/admin', templateBase: '/admin/views' });<br/>
            or <br/>
            var area = app.area('admin', { routeBase: '/admin', templateBase: '/admin/views' });<br/>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Consider using the above with the following route.
        </p>
        <pre>
          area.when('/users', { templateUrl: '/users.html' });<br/>
        </pre>
        <p>
            This would result in the route <strong>'/admin/users</strong> and a templateUrl of
            <strong>'/admin/views/users.html</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>Components & Paths</h4>
        <p>
            Basap also supports components much like you'd see in the new Angular 2.x router. Accomplishing this is
            really nothing more than convention and would be simple to implement however its nice to have it baked
            in and just work. Components are only used in <strong>ui-router</strong> or <strong>angular-route</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Setting Component Base</strong>
        </p>
        <pre>
            var area = app.area('user', { componentBase: '/components' });
        </pre>
        <p>Now consider the following route using the "User" component.</p>
        <pre>
            area.when('/user', { component: 'User' });
        </pre>
        <p>
            You'll notice that component is specified with a capital letter. This is because the controller name is
            <strong>UserController</strong>. If you named your controller userController thne it would be specified
            in all lower. Continuing on...the above route would then become:
        </p>
        <pre>
               area.when('/user', { templateUrl: '/components/user/user.html });
        </pre>
        <p>
            This also works with nested <strong>children</strong> or named <strong>views</strong> within ui-router.
        </p>
        <pre>
            area.when('/user', { views: {<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;main: { component: 'User' } <br/>
            }});<br/>
            or<br/>
                  area.when('/user', { children: <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;[{ component: 'User' }]<br/>
            });<br/>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <strong>Component Options</strong>
        </p>
        <pre>
            {<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;// the base path where components are stored, used to prepend templateUrls.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;componentBase: '/components', <br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;// the suffix used in naming controllers<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;controllerSuffix: 'Controller', <br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;// variable name used when defining the controller expression for a route.<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;controllerAs: 'ctrl', <br/>
            }
        </pre>
        <h4>Disable Area</h4>
        <p>
            There may be times where you know an area is broken or simply not ready to be loaded in production. In this
            case just set the area's option <strong>inactive</strong> to true. This will prevent it from loading.
        </p>
        <pre>
            var area = app.area('user', { inactive: true });
        </pre>
        <h4>Base Controller</h4>
        <p>
            Because basap inits outside of your Angular app it automatically adds a <strong>Base Controller</strong>
            to your application. You can extend this controller withing your basap options during initialization. The
            options to use is as follows:
        </p>
        <pre>
            var app = basap('myapp', { baseExtend: { /* your object of properties/methods for extending */ } });
        </pre>
        <p>
            You can also roll your own base controller and can do so by passing in your controller using the
            <strong>BaseCtrl</strong> option when initializing your app such as described above with baseExtend.
        </p>
        <h4>Access Angular Module</h4>
        <p>
            If there is a component or task that requires direct access to the angular module that was created for
            either your app or area you can do so as show below:
        </p>
        <pre>
            var _module = app.module; // or area.module;<br/>
            _module.constant('settings', { /* my settings running before other providers */ });
        </pre>
        <h4>Variables & Factories</h4>
        <p>
            There is one variable exposed to the $rootScope of your application. This is <strong>$area</strong>.
            Each time your application routes it stores both the previous and the current areas. This object can be
            accessed withing your view as:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <!-- the below would display the area name -->
            {{$area.current.name}}
        </pre>
        <p>
            There are two factories that are baked into basap. The are <strong>$basap</strong>, <strong>$routes</strong>
            $basap is the basap instance. This allows you to pass the instance into one of your services, controllers
            and so on. $routes is extremely simple. It return the routes of the application. It is important to note
            that <code>$routes.get();</code> returns an array of arrays. This is because when normalizing for your
            router it is easier to call <code>router.method.apply(router, route)</code>.
        </p>
        <pre>
            function ($basap){<br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;var areas = $basap.areas; // all basap areas exposed.<br/>
            }
        </pre>
        <h4>Other Options & Source</h4>
        <p>
            There are other options withing basap as well as a few others I've yet to implement. In short time is
            limited so I encourage you to read the source code (located in /src of this project). The comments are
            plentiful and if you know your way around Angular you should be able to feel your way around.

            If you have some other questions or find some bug please do fill out an
            <a href="http://github.com/origin1tech/basap/issues">issue</a>. Feel free to fork it create PR's whatever
            you wish. Literally whipped this up this afternoon so it is far from battle tested. As time permits
            we'll add in some additional features that are even more advanced but that are involved enough they
            demand documenation in order to be successful. In the meantime again read that source!!
